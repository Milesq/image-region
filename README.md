# Image Region

With this tool you can quickly higlight specific area on an image based on the coordinates x, y, width, height

## Problem

You have an image of a cat

<img width="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Milesq/image-region/main/assets/cat.jpg">

You know the program cuts somthing at these coords: `100 0 250 150` but you don't know what exactly it is. You cannot easily imagine what the field defined by the coordinates looks like.

## Solution

All you need to do is paste url image to the URL input field and coordinates separated by spaces

<img width="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Milesq/image-region/main/assets/example.png">
